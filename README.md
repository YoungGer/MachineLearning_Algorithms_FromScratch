# MachineLearning_Algorithms_FromScratch

A collection of implementations of machine learning algorithms.

## Intro

There is a saying in CS: "Talk is cheap. Show me the code". This project is just for the better understanding of machine learning algorithms through some code exercises.  
All algorithms are implemented in Python, using numpy, scipy, sklearn(just using some datasets).

## Implemented

- [Linear regression, Logistic regression](mla/linear_models.py)
- [Decision Tree](mla/trees.py)
